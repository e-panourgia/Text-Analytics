# Text Analytics

As part of this course, we implemented five core tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP):

- **N-gram Language Models & Context-Aware Spelling Correction** – [ngrams](ngrams)
- **Text Classification with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)** – [mlp](mlp)
- **NLP with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** – [rnn](rnn)
- **NLP with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** – [CNN](CNN)
- **NLP with Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs)** – [transformers](transformers)

Each task is located in its respective folder, and a detailed report is provided within each directory, documenting the methodology, implementation, and results.
